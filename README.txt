                 ** A simple Unity game created for fun with scripts in C#. **

                                   - by Doug Norton


You control a water strider bug, trying to catch bubbles floating down the river while avoiding sticks.

Click with the mouse to make the bug jump towards your cursor position.
Hit bubbles to collect them and get points.
 - Smaller bubbles float faster but give more points.
Avoid sticks and don't let yourself fall off the bottom of the screen.

                                      ------------

- The game is functionally complete and I have no definite plans to add to it. However...

                                  POSSIBLE FUTURE PLANS
                                  ---------------------
                   (Things I might add later given time and inspiration)
- Title/logo to display on the main menu
- More levels than the existing basic one, which is essentially a practice mode.
- These could include different object spawn frequencies, different physics values, or even setting up along a different orientation
